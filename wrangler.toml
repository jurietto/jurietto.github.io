## Fill this with your Cloudflare Account ID before publishing.
## To find it: open the Cloudflare dashboard -> Overview -> Account ID.

## If you manage the domain in Cloudflare you can set routes here.
## For GitHub Pages (jurietto.github.io) Cloudflare must be the authoritative
## DNS provider for that zone to route; otherwise create the route in the
## Cloudflare dashboard after publishing the Worker. If you prefer, leave
## `routes` out and add them via the dashboard.
