  This is a short video called <strong>jurietto.mp4</strong>. I made it while revisiting some After Effects basics. It’s 23 seconds long, exported in 1080p at 30fps. The audio is stereo at 48kHz. The song is “Wii Go Crazy” by Dougal & Gammer — a loud, fast UK hardcore track from 2007. I used it because I like the energy.
