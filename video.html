    This is a short video titled <strong>jurietto.mp4</strong>. I made it because I was bored, felt like relearning some After Effects basics, and didn’t really have anything else to do at the time. The video is 23 seconds long and was exported at 1920x1080 resolution (Full HD), encoded in H.264 format. It runs at 30 frames per second with a video bitrate of approximately 5400 kbps. The audio is stereo at 188 kbps, sampled at 48 kHz.

The song used is <em>“Wii Go Crazy”</em> by Dougal & Gammer — a chaotic UK hardcore track released around 2007–2008 on the Clubland X-Treme Hardcore compilation series. The title is a play on the Nintendo Wii, and the track features MC Storm doing shouty vocals over fast, euphoric synths. Dougal (a veteran from the 90s rave scene) and Gammer (who came up in the early 2000s) were known for making stuff that was loud, energetic, and unashamedly over the top. I used it here because I like the energy, and it fit the pacing of what I was editing.
