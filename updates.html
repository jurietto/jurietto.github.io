    <p>Hi, I'm Juri, and this is where I put my crap and hang out with a few honorable netizens.</p>
    <p>Heads up: Desktop view is the recommended experience, but the site is optimized for mobile. It's hosted on GitHub Pages, and I built it on a 1920x1080 laptop. Hand-coded&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t count the formatting. Lately, I&rsquo;ve been learning how to code and program, so I see this place as both an archive and a homage to that. Yeah, it looks straight out of the '90s, but that&rsquo;s not about being stuck in the past&mdash;I just like the simplicity, and it&rsquo;s easier to maintain. For chat, I use Cbox now. I used to run my own backend, but I got tired of maintaining it. </p>
    <p>My interests mostly revolve around tech, music, visual novels, self-isolation, and gothic lolita punk J-fashion &amp; subculture. I also have a random Charmmy Kitty obsession. My favorite artist of all time is Velvet Acid Christ. Anyway, not sure what else to add&mdash;happy browsing!</p>

    <p>I haven&rsquo;t posted an update since last fall, but a lot has happened since then. Over the past few months, I had a series of hospital visits and doctor&rsquo;s appointments, including spending Thanksgiving at UCLA Hospital.</p>
    <p>For Christmas, I spent the day with my brothers. We had Thai food and cake, which was nice, but my mom wasn&rsquo;t home. Her brother, who was very close to her, passed away, so she traveled to Thailand for the funeral. She stayed in Asia for about a month and also visited Hong Kong. I missed her, but she sent me videos of New Year&rsquo;s celebrations in Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Thailand. I hadn&rsquo;t realized before how big of a holiday it is there. While she was in Hong Kong, she went to Disneyland, and when she returned, she brought back souvenirs and gifts.</p>
    <p>This winter wasn&rsquo;t as cold as previous ones in California, but I still got tired of the weather. The short days made me feel more sluggish. I still like winter, but each year, I find myself enjoying it a little less.</p>
    <p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been trying to adjust my schedule and routine. Coding at night has made it harder to stick to a regular sleep schedule, and I&rsquo;ve found myself getting too absorbed in projects. I&rsquo;ve had to remind myself to take breaks and step away.</p>
    <p>One of the things I wanted to do early this year was to set up therapy, but I haven&rsquo;t done it yet. I know I need to, and I&rsquo;ve been frustrated with myself for putting it off, but as long as I get it done before late spring, I&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>

    <p>I know I always change my site, but this Rilakkuma theme is just so cozy omo... colors.</p>

      <p>I'm glad the summer is over. It was hot and I had a very scary surgery. I'm good now, I have to go to follow-up appointments and stuff. So glad fall is here!</p>

      <p>I stayed up all night doing drugs and reading about music tech stuff. I feel too depressed to produce anything, so I'm just going to try to learn a few things here and there. I really want to fix my sleep problems and reprioritize how I allocate my time. Today I have to call my doctor, pick up my meds, and fill out these annoying forms. Not really looking forward to it, but it has to be done.</p>

      <p>I just started my day and it's like 4pm... probably not going to bed for like 8-12 hours or so maybe. For some reason on the weekend I always struggle taking my meds, but I took them before it got dark at least. IDK what I'll have for dinner probably nothing special or something simple. Right now I'm just figuring out my next update &ndash; I'll include a message saying something about how I'm not really going to be updating this like all the time. It's just kinda there when I want to use it. (⌒&omega;⌒) Anyway, I forgot to mention I bought a couple of VNs from JP for my PlayStation, a MLP, and two Charmmy Kitty figures. (◕‿◕)</p>
