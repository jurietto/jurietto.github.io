<p data-start="75" data-end="292">I haven&rsquo;t posted an update since last fall, but a lot has happened since then. Over the past few months, I had a series of hospital visits and doctor&rsquo;s appointments, including spending Thanksgiving at UCLA Hospital.</p>
<p data-start="294" data-end="855">For Christmas, I spent the day with my brothers. We had Thai food and cake, which was nice, but my mom wasn&rsquo;t home. Her brother, who was very close to her, passed away, so she traveled to Thailand for the funeral. She stayed in Asia for about a month and also visited Hong Kong. I missed her, but she sent me videos of New Year&rsquo;s celebrations in Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Thailand. I hadn&rsquo;t realized before how big of a holiday it is there. While she was in Hong Kong, she went to Disneyland, and when she returned, she brought back souvenirs and gifts.</p>
<p data-start="857" data-end="1075">This winter wasn&rsquo;t as cold as previous ones in California, but I still got tired of the weather. The short days made me feel more sluggish. I still like winter, but each year, I find myself enjoying it a little less.</p>
<p data-start="1077" data-end="1325">Recently, I&rsquo;ve been trying to adjust my schedule and routine. Coding at night has made it harder to stick to a regular sleep schedule, and I&rsquo;ve found myself getting too absorbed in projects. I&rsquo;ve had to remind myself to take breaks and step away.</p>
<p data-start="1327" data-end="1552">One of the things I wanted to do early this year was to set up therapy, but I haven&rsquo;t done it yet. I know I need to, and I&rsquo;ve been frustrated with myself for putting it off, but as long as I get it done before late spring, I&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>

                <p>I'm glad the summer is over. It was hot and I had a very scary surgery. I'm good now, I have to go to follow-up appointments and stuff. So glad fall is here!</p>

                <p>I stayed up all night doing drugs and reading about music tech stuff. I feel too depressed to produce anything, so I'm just going to try to learn a few things here and there. I really want to fix my sleep problems and reprioritize how I allocate my time. Today I have to call my doctor, pick up my meds, and fill out these annoying forms. Not really looking forward to it, but it has to be done.</p>

                <p>I just started my day and it's like 4pm... probably not going to bed for like 8-12 hours or so maybe. For some reason on the weekend I always struggle taking my meds, but I took them before it got dark at least. IDK what I'll have for dinner probably nothing special or something simple. Right now I'm just figuring out my next update &ndash; I'll include a message saying something about how I'm not really going to be updating this like all the time. It's just kinda there when I want to use it. (⌒&omega;⌒) Anyway, I forgot to mention I bought a couple of VNs from JP for my PlayStation, a MLP, and two Charmmy Kitty figures. (◕‿◕)</p>
