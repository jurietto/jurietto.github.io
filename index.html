    <h1>Juri's Stuff</h1>

    <p>Hi, I'm Juri — I'm based in California and passionate about old tech, audio production, visual novels, and gothic lolita punk J-fashion. Mental and psychiatric health are very important to me; as someone who's neurodivergent, the world sometimes feels a little different to navigate. I try to take things one day at a time and give myself the space to grow. In my free time, I enjoy coding, hiking, making music, DJing, baking, journaling, and getting lost in something. I tend to keep to myself, but I'm always open to conversation if you ever feel like reaching out. As for work, I’ve done a bit of everything — from food service and hospitality to computer repair.</p>
