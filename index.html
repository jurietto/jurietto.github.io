    <h1>Juri's Stuff</h1>

    <p><em>I'm Juri, based in California. I’m into old tech, audio production, visual novels, and gothic lolita punk J-fashion. Mental and psychiatric health are important to me — I’m neurodivergent, and sometimes the world feels a little different to navigate. I take things one day at a time and try to give myself the space to grow. I enjoy coding, hiking, making music, DJing, baking, and journaling. I tend to keep to myself, but I’m always open to conversation if you ever feel like reaching out. Work-wise, I’ve done a bit of everything, from food service and hospitality to computer repair.</em></p>
