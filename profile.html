    <tr><td>Name</td><td>Juri</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Presence</td><td>Mostly here to read and work on things. Lately that means coding, small tools, and making music. I post sometimes, but I’m usually quiet.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Tone</td><td>Calm and low-key. A little awkward. Occasionally silly without meaning to be.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Age range</td><td>Early thirties.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Time pattern</td><td>Inconsistent. Usually late at night. Sometimes I disappear for a while.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Posting rhythm</td><td>Occasional. Comes in short bursts. Long silences are normal. Sometimes AFK for days.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Interaction style</td><td>Minimal replies most of the time. I read more than I talk. Social and chat anxiety makes longer conversations hard.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Interests (general)</td><td>Old websites. Small software experiments. Tinkering with tools. Keeping notes and journals that may or may not go anywhere.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Interests (creative)</td><td>Drafts. Half-finished ideas. Music. Web design. Some graphic design.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Music</td><td>Electronic. Often about mental health or obscure topics. Many tracks are unfinished.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Writing style</td><td>Short sentences. A lot of ellipses. Fragmented thoughts. I write when there’s something to say.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Memory</td><td>Spotty. Selective. Not always chronological.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Boundaries</td><td>Please be kind. No harassment or stalking. I deal with PTSD, so I keep things gentle and low pressure.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Expectations</td><td>Low expectations right now. I prefer being quietly surprised rather than disappointed.</td></tr>

<h2>Notes</h2>
    <!-- Notes -->
    <div class="profile-notes">
      <p>
I spend most of my time working with code and music. The way I work tends to be slow and incremental, with an emphasis on small systems, tools, and back-end ideas. Coding has become something stabilizing for me. It helps give structure to my thinking and makes it easier to stay grounded, especially when other things feel noisy or disorganized. I’ve been programming for many years, but only more recently has it become part of my everyday routine.
</p>

<p>
Music is another long-term part of my work. I began producing more regularly around 2017, after earlier experiments using GarageBand for various art projects. The sounds I return to most often are influenced by hyperpop, hardstyle, hardcore, hard dance, and techno. I’m currently working toward an album, taking things slowly and focusing on staying consistent. The plan is to release it sometime in 2027, without rushing the process.
</p>

<p>
Mental health has a direct effect on how I work and how I relate to other people. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2020 and continue to deal with PTSD and depression. These factors affect my energy, focus, and comfort in social situations, and I may come across as quiet, hesitant, or awkward at times. Because of this, I try to move at a pace that remains manageable and doesn’t rely on constant pressure.
</p>

<p>
I also have a long-running attachment to Charmmy Kitty. It’s something familiar and comforting. I appreciate how understated and gentle she is, and how she exists without needing much explanation. At this point, it feels less like a particular interest and more like a small, consistent personality quirk.
